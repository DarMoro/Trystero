			<p class="aboutOne"><span class="firstWord">Founded</span> in 2016 by Martin Trystar, TryStero has provided a trustworthy, speedy and cost-effective way to send and receive parcels, packages and anything that your business needs couriered. We have a dedicated team of drivers and excellent tracking and customer support. Based locally in Cork and 100% Irish owned, we believe in giving back to the community that has given us so much and we are proud to still maintain our root of opertions in the Port of Cork.
			<br>
			<br>
			Our express was introduced in 2017 and since then we have been growing strongly with the help of our dedicated team and, of course, our satisfied customers. In August of 2016 we quickly moved from inter-county deliveries to international and introduced a whole host of services to help us get your parcels to the desired hands as soon, and as safely, as possible. We have been voted best delivery company in Cork two years in a row and look forward to growing and improving in every way that we can. We hope to grow with the city of Cork and are proud to facilitate them in every means possible while we do this.</p>
